Field maps
==========
This module allows creating field maps using symbolic expressions through the sympy library.
It is also possible to import field maps generated by Opera. This module generates a Tosca Keyword which
can then be easily used in a line. Fitting methods are also available to calculate the field decay based on
an Enge function.
