"""Contributed commands module not part of Zgoubi core but added to Zgoubidoo.

This module consists of contributed *commands* or *elements* that are not part of Zgoubi itself but are contributed to
Zgoubidoo. In particular, subclasses of the usual Zgoubi commands specialized to specific applications or machines can
be described in this module.

The organization of this module is such that a distinct sub-module is created per machine or center.
