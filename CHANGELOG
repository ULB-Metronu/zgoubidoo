2019.4 - What will it be?
    - Surprise.

2019.3 - Coherent support of the high-level 'sequence' API and synchrotron radiation
    - [FEATURE] A brand new 'sequence' API (see the 'sequences' module) supporting lattice description that are
    code independent. They can be automatically loaded and converted from MAD-X Twiss files onto Zgoubi or MAD-X inputs;
    - [FEATURE] More complete Twiss computation module taking advantage of the survey and global reference frame for
    coordinates transformation. Twiss parameters are now correct also for strange lattices with arbitraty rotations;
    - [FEATURE] Now supports running MAD-X as well, with all the same nice functionalities.
    - [BUG FIXES] Many, many, many bug fixes;

2019.2 - Brand new support for concurrent execution of multiple Zgoubi's instances
    - Full support for concurrent multiprocessing execution is provided;
    - Improvement capabilities for multi-dimensional parametric mappings;
    - Lots of bug fixes and documentation update.

2019.1 - First stable release.
    - See the announcement in the documentation.

2018.1 - First release!
    - Support all Zgoubi elements, altough some commands (in particular related to electric elements or spin tracking)
    have never been tested;
    - Step-by-step computation of Twiss parameters (in a similar fashion to what pyzgoubi does) using 11 particules.
