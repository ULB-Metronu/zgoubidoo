# zgoubido
A Python 3 interface for Zgoubi. Zgoubido is intended to follow a modern Python design and aims at being easy to use. Interactive use with iPython or Jupyter Notebook is supported and encouraged.

Zgoubi is a ray-tracing (tracking) code for beam dynamics simulations. Many magnetic and electric elements are supported. It is maintained by François Méot on SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/zgoubi/.

## Design goals

- Fully featured interface to Zgoubi
- Written in high-quality Python 3 with type-hints
- The library interface and use-n-feel must be Jupyter notebook friendly
- Decoupling between a low-level use (simple Python interface to generate Zgoubi input files and run the execut)
